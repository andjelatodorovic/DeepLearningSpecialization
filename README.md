# DeepLearningSpecialization
My solutions to the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
Currently just downloaded as Jupyter Notebooks, and I will link the pure Python3 code repositories bellow:
- [x] Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Week 1)
- [] Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (Week 2)
- [] Convolutional Neural Networks (Week 4)
- [] Sequence models
