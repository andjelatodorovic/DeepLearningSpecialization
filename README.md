# DeepLearningSpecialization
My solutions to the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
Currently just downloaded as Jupyter Notebooks, and I will link the pure Python3 code repositories bellow:
- [x] Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Week 1) https://github.com/kobrica/DeepLearningPurePython3/tree/master/NeuralNetworks
- [x] Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (Week 2)
- [x] Convolutional Neural Networks (Week 4)
- [x] Sequence models (Week 5)
